Zarafa CardDav
--------------

This is a project that tries to make users' contacts in [Zarafa](http://www.zarafa.com)-groupware
accessible via a CardDav-interface. A fully functional CardDav-interface
would allow for a full integration of MacOS- and Linux-Clients
with the Zarafa Groupware Server.

More detailed instructions can be found on the [Zarafa-wiki](http://www.zarafa.com/wiki/index.php/CardDAV_Interface) and the [Zarafa Community Hub](http://community.zarafa.com/pg/plugins/project/397/developer/rvjr/contact-access-via-webdav-and-carddav). 
There is also a [thread at the Zarafa forum](http://forums.zarafa.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=6039) about this CardDav-interface.
